            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how we live and work; education is no exception. With social distancing measures in place, educators and students worldwide were forced to shift to online learning platforms. While many were already used to it, the sudden shift to digital education has brought a host of challenges, particularly for those unfamiliar with online learning platforms.

                This situation is even more challenging in developing countries like South Africa, with most students not adept at finding their way around the internet and many lecturers lacking the skills and knowledge to facilitate online classes effectively. To explore the impact of educators’ skills, knowledge, and experience in e-learning on student support, a recent study focusing on an open-distance e-learning institution in South Africa was conducted, putting the participants under a training program designed to boost their digital skills. The study also solicited feedback from students’ discussion forums to see how their learning experiences differed when their lecturers were technologically adept versus when they were not.
                
                The study found that before completing the training program, most lecturers lacked the knowledge and digital skills necessary for open-distance e-learning, negatively impacting their attitudes toward using technology in their teaching and for student support. However, the skill-building program significantly improved their digital literacy and positively shifted their perspectives. This suggests that educational institutions should offer their staff continuous professional development in distance education and e-learning to improve the quality of students’ learning subsequently. Nowadays, some of the most common e-learning methods imparted in corporate training include web-based learning such as Learning Management Systems, virtual classrooms, video modules with human instructors, mobile learning, etc. In addition, the study recommends using surveys to assess academic staff’s readiness for online teaching and create a platform for them to share information and their training program experiences.
                
                Moreover, Institutions must train their staff to adopt and adapt to new technologies effectively for better teaching and improved student learning outcomes. The study also highlights the importance of engaging students creatively through digital platforms, such as discussion forums, which is essential to foster a collaborative learning environment. Nevertheless, access to technology and the Internet is a significant challenge in developing countries like South Africa, hindering educational opportunities. Universities can help provide access to these resources. Still, more needs to be done to address the digital divide, such as investing in infrastructure, improving internet access in remote and rural areas, and exploring innovative solutions in schools like mobile learning. According to Ernst & Young, governments will play a key role in bridging the digital divide and boosting digital transformation. Some solutions to this challenge for the educational sector include affordable, robust broadband internet service, internet-enabled devices that meet user needs, and access to digital literacy training.
                
                Overall, the study’s findings highlight the importance of investing in faculty development and skills-building programs to improve the quality of online education, particularly in developing countries where access to technology and the Internet may be limited, ensuring education becomes more accessible and inclusive.</p>

            <h2>What Tech Trends Should Nonprofits Pay Attention To?</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">…</p>

            <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unique challenges to the nonprofit world. Protocols such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders have disrupted many nonprofit plans and programs. In response, nonprofits have embraced technology as means to overcome new challenges. A dominant trend has been an increase in the use of ICTs (Information and Communication Technology) such as websites, emails, social media, chat, and video conferencing software. They have been useful in connecting nonprofit workers, volunteers, donors, and recipients in their activities. However, the benefits of ICTs have not been distributed equally around the world. The global digital divide has excluded peoples who do not have universal access to reliable internet. It is thus, important that nonprofits pay attention to how ICT trends can be used to serve everyone.

                Impacts of Covid-19
                
                The Nonprofit Technology Trends report, conducted by Sage Intacct, highlight the five biggest impacts of Covid-19 on nonprofits:
                
                Program disruptions
                Challenges shifting to a remote work
                Innovations from virtual environment
                Decrease in funding
                Increased demand for services
                
                The Covid-19 pandemic has brought nonprofits waves of constant change and uncertainty. They have been experienced not only by nonprofits, but also their donors, supporters, and recipients. With forced closures, extended periods of remote work, and very inconsistent reopening plans, the need for adjustment have become crucial for nonprofits to carry on their work.

                Recent ICT Trends
                
                The Global NGO Technology Survey, also conducted by Nonprofit Tech for Good, showed that in 2021:
                
                32% of NGOs use internal communications software such as Slack
                79.3% of NGOs use video conferencing software such as Zoom
                
                It is seen in the above reports that nonprofits worldwide have been rapidly expanding their use of technology with an increased reliance on them. ICTs such as the web, email, social media, internal communications software, and video conferencing software have become powerful online communication tools that nonprofits have to inspire philanthropy, create awareness, and engage momentum for their mission and programs.
                
                As nonprofits embrace digital transformations since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, long standing issues of the digital divide are illuminated. The matter is that many rural and low- income communities of the world lack reliable, affordable internet access. People who do not have connection to the internet are denied access to the benefits of technology as more devices and systems reliant on internet connectivity emerge. However, technology is meant to be an equalizing tool, not a source of division. Collective efforts are required to ensure universal digital accessibility.</p>

            How to Facilitate Communication and Collaboration between Remote Teams

          As the world becomes further globalized, the number of international workers and volunteers in humanitarian work (remote teams) is on the rise. As well, greater numbers of local personnel are becoming involved with humanitarian organizations. The goal is to have international and local teams work together on their mission. The challenge, however, is navigating work between two remotely located teams. Technology tools can help facilitate communication and collaboration between remote teams. When using such tools, it is important that a) necessary resources are available to all workers, b) workers receive digital literacy training, and c) that communication tools are centralized.

          The Number of Remote Workers are Growing

          In recent years, the number of remote workers around the world has increased dramatically. According to Buffer’s 2020 State of Work Report, 57% of those polled work from home 100% of the time. The increasing trend of remote workers has grown even more since the Covid-19 pandemic.
